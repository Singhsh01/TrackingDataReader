# TrackingDataReader
This repository contains a C++ program designed to read, process, and analyze 3D tracking data stored in CSV files. The primary functionality includes extracting positional data from CSV files, calculating statistical metrics such as the mean position and jitter, and computing the Euclidean distance between two sets of tracking coordinates.
